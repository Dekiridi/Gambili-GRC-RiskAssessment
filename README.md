# Gambili-GRC-RiskAssessment

## Overview

This project presents a structured Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) risk assessment for **Gambili LLC**, a fast-growing e-commerce company headquartered in Nigeria. The assessment aims to identify critical security gaps, propose mitigation controls, and enhance compliance with international cybersecurity standards.

## 🛡️ Background

Gambili LLC recently suffered:
- A data breach involving customer PII
- A ransomware attack leading to service disruption
- Regulatory warnings related to NDPR and GDPR non-compliance

To address these challenges, a cybersecurity risk assessment was conducted using:
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** – for establishing an Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- **ISO/IEC 27002:2022** – for selecting and implementing security controls
- **NIST 800-53 & NIST CSF** – for supporting control frameworks

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify and prioritize **residual risks**
- Map controls to **ISO/IEC 27002:2022**
- Provide a roadmap for **monitoring control effectiveness**
- Align with regulatory frameworks like **NDPR**, **GDPR**, and **PCI-DSS**

## 🔎 Key Risks Identified

1. **Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation**
2. **Ineffective Detection and Incident Response**
3. **Poor Privileged Access Management**

## 🔐 Controls Implemented (ISO/IEC 27002:2022)

### 🧱 Risk 1: Lateral Movement

- Control 5.18: Access rights lifecycle and segregation
- Control 8.3: Information access restriction

## 📊 Monitoring Effectiveness

- Penetration test results
- Log audits and SIEM alerts
- Privilege reviews and SoD enforcement

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- ISO/IEC 27001:2022 & ISO/IEC 27002:2022
- NIST 800-53, NIST CSF
- SIEM (e.g., Wazuh, Splunk)
- Microsoft Word, Google Docs

## 📝 Outcome

The project delivered a detailed GRC framework and control implementation guide for Gambili LLC, reducing cybersecurity exposure and aligning its operations with international compliance standards.
